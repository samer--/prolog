This package provides library(callgraph), a tool for compiling a graph of calls between predicates in a module.

---++++ Prerequisites

The graph layout programs from the GraphViz library (http://graphviz.org/) are
used to render the end result. Whilst you can produce a dot file without them,
you will need them for the final rendering. 
On Mac OS X with MacPorts installed, do this at the bash prompt.
==
$ sudo port install graphviz
==
On Debian based systems, do this:
==
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
==
And so on.
You will need a PDF viewer to see the results.



---++++ Simple usage

To produce a call graph as a PDF, make sure that both this module and the
module you wish to analyse are loaded, then do this:
==
?- module_dotpdf(<module_name>,[]).
==
This will produce a PDF file <module_name>.pdf in the current directory.
Often, the default layout program, dot, will produce a very wide graph.
This can sometimes be alleviated by using the unflatten program from the
Graphviz tools. In module_dotpdf/2, the default layout method does actually
use unflatten without any parameters, but if this is not enough, you can
provide values for the -f, -l and -c switches of unflatten (see the man
page for unflatten for more details). For example, to produce a graph of 
callgraph itself, you can try the following:
==
$ swipl
?- use_module(library(callgraph)).
?- module_dotpdf(callgraph,[method(unflatten([fl(4),c(4)]))]).
==

---++++ More complex usage

Version 0.2.5 adds support for graphing multiple modules.
For example, to graph modules callgraph and dot to a file
called test.pdf, use
==
modules_dotpdf([callgraph,dot],[method(unflatten([fl(4),c(4)]))],test).
==

---++++ Output formats

If you want the dot language source file, use module_dot/2 instead. The
method option is then inapplicable.

The code can also produce rendered graphs in any format supported by
Graphviz, but this functionality is not currently exposed.

---++++ Limitations

The graph compilation relies on prolog_walk_code/1 to do the actual code
analysis. This does a good job in most cases, using meta-predicate declarations
or inferred meta-predicates to detect many high-order calling patterns.
Ironically enough, callgraph fails to analyse itself fully because
prolog_walk_code/1 does not detect that it itself calls a given predicate
for each call detected. Thus, in the example, there is no edge from 
assert_module_graph/1 to assert_edge/4.

---++++ Planned enhancements

Allow more control of subgraph layout and style.
Handling of recorded database is a bit unsatisfactory.
The system for dealing with style attributes is
a bit messy and could be cleaned up.
